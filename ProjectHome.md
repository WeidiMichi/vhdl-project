This repository is dedicated to the project in System Design with VHDL - Mid Sweden University. The project is an implementation in VHDL of the Sobel edge detection operator: the system takes the images from a VGA camera, process them in order to emphasize edges of the objects and then display the result on a VGA monitor. Moreover the distance between the camera and the object in front of it it is measured using an ultrasonic sensor and the distance is displayed on the monitor.
